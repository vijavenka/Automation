A key challenge is delivering a reward that is easy to administer, simple and attractive enough for the recipient.Specsavers, have chosen epoints to further improve their incentive programmes. Jill Clark, Specsavers Director Customer Services says, âBefore switching to epoints we had numerous incentives available for our Partners who run Specsavers stores in the UK and Ireland. We conducted some research and found Partners wanted their teams to be able to choose their own rewards and that could be used for any occasion.â Matt Norbury, epoints Founder says, âThe partnership with Specsavers made perfect sense as they were looking for a reward mechanism that was flexible to be used for different incentives but that is simple to operate.âWhat do stores get?Specsavers, like any successful organisation understand what measures within the business drive success but unlike most organisations have defined the exact level of reward to allocate to each measure. Everything from financial to personal development targets will be included ensuring store staff are rewarded for the things that matter in a meaningful way.How does it work?Specsavers manage the allocation of epoints from a central administration portal so they can reward store teams in real time based upon each incentive campaign. epoints hit store accounts instantly so Partners and their teams can browse the millions of items available within the âspendâ section of epoints.com. The epoints redemption range is one of the biggest in the world where items can be delivered direct to store.About SpecsaversSpecsavers is a partnership of almost 2,000 locally owned and run businesses in Europe and across the globe, all committed to delivering high quality, affordable optical and hearing care.Our expert opticians carry out professional eye tests using the latest optical equipment.
